Even worse, if two peers are both in this state they will not be able to connect at all. This has obviously a detrimental effect on the overall speed. \n\nThe way to solve the problem involves opening the ports used for incoming connections (the same range you defined in your client) on the firewall and/or configuring your NAT server to use a basic form of NAT for that range instead of NAPT (the actual process differs widely between different router models. Check your router documentation and/or support forum. You will also find lots of information on the subject at PortForward). \n\nAlso if you need help please come into our IRC chat room or post in the forums your problems. We are always glad to help out.\n\nThank You",
