High-performance BitTorrent Tracker

###### Installing under Linux

- Debian

Use the following commands to install the C++ dependencies on Debian. The g++ version should be at least 4.7.


```bash
apt-get install cmake g++ libboost-dev libmysqlclient-dev make zlib1g-dev
```
- Centos/RedHat

Use the following commands to install some of the C++ dependencies on CentOS, Fedora Core and Red Hat. The g++ version should be at least 4.7.

```bash
yum install boost-devel gcc-c++ mysql-devel
```

Enter the following commands in a terminal. Be patient while g++ is running, it'll take a few minutes.

- Geting sources and compiling

```bash
wget https://github.com/whocares-openscene/u-232-xbt/raw/master/xbt.tar.gz
tar xfz xbt.tar.gz
cd xbt/Tracker
```

Replace `server.h` and `server.cpp` and add `xbt_tracker.conf` from the U-232 V4 archive then run:

```
./make.sh
```

> Remember to add your mysql connect details TO xbt_tracker.conf

If no errors occurred during install then to start XBT tracker run

```bash
./xbt_tracker
```

To stop XBT run

```bash
killall xbt_tracker
```

#### Upgrade to U-232 V5

If running the upgrade sql then you need to check a few points first:

- Go to your `phpmyadmin` and check what the last id is on `cleanup_manager` and edit the `upgrade.sql` inserts accordingly.
- Check the staff panel last id and edit the upgrade.sql inserts accordinally, `userclasses` in `class_config` table are default 0-6 so if you have different classes then edit that table first adding the new classes and values also edit `cache/class_config.php`.
- Once your upgrade is completed with new code in place simply edit your announce urls in all seeding torrents and change `announce.php?passkey=` to `announce.php?torrent_pass=` and all torrents should resume as normal, same applies if switching to `XBT_TRACKER`, you would use the `XBT_TRACKER` format for announce url in client.
- Open the `upgrade.sql` and update your database adding all additional entries, once done backup `cache/staff_settings.php` also `cache/staff_settings2.php`, backup `include/ann_config.php and include/config.php`, then delete all the old v4 files from `ftp` except `pic` folder, `torrents`, then upload the v5 code onto your server except the install folder, when prompted at pic folder hit skip and it will only add the newer files depending on ftp client. Open your `ann_config.php` and `config.php` files then open the `install/extra/ann_config.sample.php` and `config.sample.php`, transfer all your config settings to the newer files then save and rename them removing.sample out the file name, then transfer them into include folder, ensure you chmod any new cache files added also.

#### Set up U-232 V5

> **Please take note**:
> Before you begin installation it is very important that your server is configured correctly and has all the required source code dependencies.

Ensure your error reporting is enabled on the server and you are logging the errors and not displaying them.

A error on install is a failure to adhere to setup instructions.

If you experience a failure then a properly configured server will report that issue, no excuses required.

Install `memcached` and zend `opcode` cache before installing U-232 V5.

1. Create a directory one up from root so it resides beside it not inside it, named bucket.
	1. Then inside the bucket folder make another and name it avatar.
	2. If you use your own names for those folders then you need to edit `bitbucket.php` and `img.php` defines at top of the files.
	3. Then add a `.htaccess` and `index.html` files into both newly created folders.
	4. Then chmod those above folders.
	5. Then extract `pic.tar.gz`, `Log_Viewer.tar.gz` and `GeoIp.tar.gz` and ensure they are not inside an extra folder from being archived.
	6. Then upload the code to your server and `chmod`: 
		- `cache` and all nested files and folders.
		- `dir_list`
		- `uploads`
		- `uploadsub`
		- `imdb/cache`
		- `imdb/images`
		- `include`
		- `include/backup`
		- `include/settings/settings.txt`
		- `install/extra/config.phpsample.php/config.xbtsample.php`
		- `install/extra/ann_config.phpsample.php/ann_config.xbtsample.php`
		- `sqlerr_logs`
		- `torrents`

2. Create a new database user and password via `phpmyadmin`.

3. Point to <https://yoursite.com/install/index.php> - *fill in all the required data and choose XBT or default* - then log in.

4. Create a second user on entry named System ensure it's user id = 2 so you don't need to alter the `autoshout` function on `include/user_functions.php`.

5. `Sysop` is added automatically to the array in `cache/staff_settings.php` and `cache/staff_setting2.php`.

6. `Staff` is automatically added to the same two files, but you have to make sure the member is offline before you promote them.
